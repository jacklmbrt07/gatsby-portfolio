                After a stint as a Construction Engineer, I became so fascinated
                with computer programming and made the difficult yet ruminated
                decision to switch careers. During that stint, I worked at the
                Oroville-Thermalito Dam complex in Northern California where I
                picked up some of the hardest lessons in project management, and
                leadership. Web-development has allowed me to utilize my problem
                solving skills, while simultaneously allowing me to let my
                creative side flow freely. I enjoy problem solving, and use my
                hyper focus on attention to detail to create functional yet
                minimalistic designs. I would like to utilize my skills in the
                tech world to lead a team with a destination that is both
                ethical and economic.

                I graduated with a B.S. degree of Civil Engineering in 2017 from
                San Jose State University. I love traveling and have spent much
                time abroad in Australia, Southeast Asia, and other
                destinations. Whilst traveling I picked up photography as a
                hobby. I treat my photographs, vinyl records, and books like my
                children. I enjoy all things art, history, San Franciscos and
                Oaklands excellent food and drink establishments, and could
                spend hours in philosophical discussions with no winner or
                loser.
